# DSMR Workflow

the DPMR framework explores the three-dimensional space of optimal data subsets, algorithms, and hyperparameters. The MR module of the framework acts like a child seeking a path, exploring the three-dimensional space to find the optimal combination. Guided by Bayesian optimization, the child possesses the ability for global exploration. Meanwhile, evaluation metrics act as a compass, guiding the gradual optimization of the model, while the DS module adjusts the data to provide the child with suitable learning materials. During the iterative process, the dataset (X,Y) first undergoes a round of random shuffling, followed by step a, where it is divided into subsets of size N, with each subset eliminating a different portion to prevent excessive differences in data distribution. Next, each subset enters the MR module in step b, where normalization is applied, and Bayesian optimization is used to globally explore the hyperparameter combinations of the chosen algorithms. Then, step c employs cross-validation to evaluate the results, ranking all models by performance, retaining the best model and data subset combination, and selecting the optimal subset K for the next round. If data elimination reaches a performance bottleneck, the framework switches to step d to recycle samples, similarly dividing and re-adding the eliminated data by size N, and entering the MR module for model exploration. Finally, step e continues to evaluate and rank the models, terminating the process when model performance reaches a bottleneck or data can no longer be divided.
